# trackend #

## Purpose ##

`"trackend"` is triggered by Popcorn when any instance of a plugin has its `end` method invoked. `"trackend"` is to be used with the `on` and `off` instance methods.

For example:
* `popcornInstance.on( "trackend", callbackFunction );`
* `popcornInstance.off( "trackend", callbackFunction );`

## Use Cases ##

Trigger a visual cue ( such as a transition ) whenever a plugin has its `end` method called.
